### Hello, my name is João Paulo Albuquerque. I am an environmental engineer working on data analysis and data science projects. I have experience in application of projects aimed at Environmental Engineering and Data Analysis.

### I'll use this page as a portfolio of my projects in data science/analysis. Among the main ones already done, I have my final paper for the Environmental Engineering course, in which I do a bibliometric analysis on Payments for Environmental Services in Brazil (PSA), and also has the IBM Data Science Course Completion Project, along with notebooks and presentation.

### Shall we connect? 👋🏽
